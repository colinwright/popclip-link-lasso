# LinkLasso â€” A PopClip Extension

Scans selected text for all URLs and opens each one in a new browser tab.

## How It Works

LinkLasso finds URLs from two sources in your text selection:

*   **Hyperlinks**: It extracts the destination URL from any hyperlinks (e.g., from an `<a href="...">` tag).
*   **Plain Text**: It finds any URLs written out as plain text.

All unique URLs are then opened in your default web browser.

## Installation

1.  Download the latest `LinkLasso.popclipextz` file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/colinwright/popclip-linklasso/releases).
2.  Double-click the downloaded file to install it in PopClip.

## Usage

1.  Select any block of text that contains one or more URLs.
2.  When the PopClip bar appears, click the LinkLasso icon.
3.  All unique URLs found in the selection will open in new tabs.
