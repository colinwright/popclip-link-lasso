# PopClip Extension: Open All Links

A PopClip extension that scans selected text for all URLs (web links) and opens each one in a new browser tab.

## Features
* Finds multiple http/https URLs in any block of selected text.
* Opens each unique URL in your default web browser.
* Prioritizes links from HTML `href` attributes if available, falling back to raw text scanning.

## Installation
1.  Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/colinwright/popclip-open-all-links/releases).
2.  Download the `OpenAllLinks.popclipextz` file from the latest release.
3.  Double-click the downloaded `.popclipextz` file to install it in PopClip.

## Usage
1.  Select any block of text that contains one or more URLs.
2.  When the PopClip bar appears, click the "Extract & Open URLs" icon (it looks like a chain link in a circle).
3.  All unique URLs found in the text will be opened in new tabs in your default browser.
